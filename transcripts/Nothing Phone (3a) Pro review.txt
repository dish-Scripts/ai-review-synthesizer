 Nothing has a new mid-range phone, the Nothing Phone 3A Pro. So what's new here and could this be the best we've seen yet from Nothing's A series? I'm Will for GSM Arena and I must find out and are Nothing Phone 3A Pro review. The Nothing Phone 3A Pro brings a new moniker to the Nothing Mid-range family, and there are a few changes if you're comparing it to last year's Nothing Phone 2A Plus. These include a larger display, a snapdragon chipset, and a third camera on the back, which is a three-time zoom. We'll note that there's also a regular Nothing Phone 3A, which is much the same phone as this one, except for some changes in the cameras. Nothing has maintained the same unique design, which uses a see-through backing to show off some internal parts of the phone. The three LED lights, which Nothing Calls Glyphs are back too. Nothing says the frame is made of aluminum, though it feels like plastic, and the back is made of glass this time around. The Ingress protection has been improved, it's now IP64, which is better against dust. It isn't protection against water submersion, though, just splashes. Let's talk a bit more about those Glyph LEDs. They were recurring feature on Nothing phones, and they can light up for different purposes. These include notification alerts, a ring light for shooting with the cameras, and visual feedback for the volume and charging, and some third-party apps can integrate with them too. There's a dedicated glyph interface for controlling their behavior, and you can use the Composer app to create custom ringtones slash glyph patterns. Another interesting hardware feature is something called the Essential Key. Clicking this button allows you to quickly take a screenshot, holding it down records a voicemail along with the screenshot, and double-clicking it opens the place they're stored, called the Essential Space. The Essential Key is an interesting novelty, but might not be so useful to people that don't have these particular note-taking habits. The display of the Nothing Phone 3A Pro is a 6.77 inch OLED with a 1080p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. The screen looks good overall, it's plenty sharp, and has support for both 10-bit color and HDR10 plus video playback. There's been an improvement in the max brightness this time around. We measured up to over 760 nits with the manual slider, and this can boost to over 1300 nits in auto mode when you need it. And while the 120Hz refresh rate smooths out your swiping and scrolling, the phone can dial that down to 60Hz when it's idling to save energy. But as we've seen on previous models, there's no support for high-frame rate gaming here. For audio, there's a set of stereo speakers. They have very good loudness, and the sound quality is decent, with clean mids and highs, and some bass. You can wake up and unlock the phone using the optical under-dyspli-finger pin reader, and it's quite responsive. And the nothing phone 3A Pro comes with 128 or 256k of storage depending on the market, that's not expandable through microSD. The interface of the phone is the latest nothing-out-west 3.1 running on top of Android 15. It's not so far away from stock Android, but with some extra features and brand-specific aesthetics. These include monochrome icons and custom nothing widgets on the home screen. A signature of nothing phones was a pixelated font through the interface, which they've done away with by default. You can still enable it for the settings menu through experimental features. As far as nothing-specific AI-powered features go, there aren't a ton. Outside of the essential space we touched upon earlier, the AI can make summarizations of text that you made screenshots of, and transcribe your voice memos in the text. And for support, nothing promises three years of Android updates and six years of security patches here. The chipset of the nothing phone 3A Pro is a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, it's known to be solid mid-range silicon. It's meant to be an improvement over the MediaTek chipset within last year's nothing phone 2A Plus, mainly an AI capability. In benchmarks, the nothing phone 3A Pro holds up well against its peers in the same price range, but still falling short of the flagship killing nothing phone 2. Overall, the nothing phone 3A Pro handles both regular tasks and gaming quite smoothly. The thermal management is excellent too, in our prolonged stress tests, the phone displayed very little thermal throttling or performance loss. The phone has a 5,000 milliamp hour battery, and the nothing phone 3A Pro earned a solid active use score in our battery life tests. Their support for 50 watt charging here, and there's no charger included in the box. With our proper adapter, we were able to charge the 3A Pro from 0 to 60% in half an hour, and a full charge took an hour and six minutes. It's nothing to speedy. And now we have the cameras. On the back, there are three. There's a 50 megapixel main cam, a 50 megapixel 3x telephoto, and an 8 megapixel ultra-wide cam. This ultra-wide has been swapped out from a 50 megapixel one, arguably a downgrade, but having a telephoto cam this time around makes for some extra versatility. The main camera captures nice photos at 12.5 megapixels due to pixel-winning. The detail is great, and there's very little noise. Contrast and dynamic range are also very good, and the same goes for colors. And here are some shots of people. They look good, with detailed facial features and pleasing skin tones. The main cam can capture some solid two times digital zoom photos. The quality is decent, and also far away from those of the regular shots. The main cam holds up well in low-light conditions, where the nothing phone 3A Pro uses automatic night mode processing. It captures plenty of detail, with low noise. Shadows are well developed, and the dynamic range is great. The new Periscope telephoto cam is quite solid, capturing very sharp and detailed 3x zoom photos during the day, with colors that are well matched to the main camera. The telephoto cam is also great for portraits. Plus, it's capable of close focusing, which means you can take macro close-up shots with it. In low-light, the telephoto camera maintains its stellar performance. The three times shots are sharp, and have plenty of detail, and a wide dynamic range. During the day, the ultra-wide photos are very good for an 8 megapixel camera. There's a very good amount of detail, and nice colors. At night, the ultra-wide shots are soft, but the dynamic range and contrast are quite good. Selfies come from a 50 megapixel front facing cam at the native resolution, which is a bit excessive. The overall quality is good, with nice skin tones and texture, but we feel it could have been even better with some pixel-bending. The nothing phone 3A Pro can capture 4K video with this main and selfie cameras. Both the ultra-wide and telephoto are limited to 1080p. The main cameras 4K videos are great, with plenty of detail, nice looking colors, and practically no noise. The dynamic range could be a bit better though. If you simply click the zoom on the viewfinder, you get a 4K crop from the main cam. You need to switch the resolution in order to be able to shoot video with the telephoto. And despite being only 1080p, we like the output from the dedicated zoom cam better than the digital zoom. It provides a good amount of detail, and the colors look nice too. The 1080p video from the ultra-wide is not great, but it's still usable if you need it. The main camera uses always on stabilization at every resolution. It works very well to iron out shake from walking. Here's a look at a nighttime video clip from the main cam. We've seen better in terms of dynamic range on other phones. However, the telephoto camera surprised us. It continues its stellar performance streak with nighttime video recording. So there you have it, the nothing phone 3A Pro packs a large screen, loud speakers, a good chipset and battery life and a nice set of cameras, especially the telephoto. Plus you get some interesting features like the C-Thru design, glyph lights, and the essential key. There are just a few nitpicks. There's only splash roofing here in a market full of IP68 rated phones. The telephoto camera can't shoot in 4K, even though it should support it. And in western markets there's only a single storage tier. But all in all, if you're shopping for a phone with solid camera chops in this price range, then the nothing phone 3A Pro is a unique proposition that's worth checking out. Thanks for watching guys. Here are links to a couple of alternative mid-range options, the Motorola Edge 50 Pro and the Realme 14 Pro Plus. Let us know what you think and I'll see you on the next one.
