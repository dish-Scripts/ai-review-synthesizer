You are an expert product analyst. Based on the following summarized reviews of a product, perform a meta-analysis.

1. Identify the **Top 5–6 key features** discussed (e.g., Battery, Display, Performance).
2. For each feature, explain:
   - What multiple reviewers agreed on
   - Any disagreements or differing opinions
3. Create a final section:
   - ✅ **Consolidated Pros**
   - ❌ **Consolidated Cons**
   - 💡 **Unique Comments** (said by only one reviewer)

Use clear markdown-style formatting.
